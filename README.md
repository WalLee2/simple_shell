A simple shell for <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com/">Holberton School</a>. This is a culmination of everything we have
learned about the C programming thusfar.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

chdir (man 2 chdir)
close (man 2 close)
closedir (man 3 closedir)
execve (man 2 execve)
exit (man 3 exit)

```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Here is the line to compile:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
```
End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
